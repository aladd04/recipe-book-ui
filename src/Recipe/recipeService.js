      "Ingredients": "- 1 frozen pizza dough (usually found in the frozen bread/rolls section) or you can use a premade pizza crust.

Something on the sweeter side\n- ½ an onion chopped\n- 1 small can of pineapple tidbits drained (optional)",
      "Instructions": "- If you bought frozen dough, thaw it for a couple of hours\n- If you are using uncooked chicken, rinse it and cut off any thing that doesn’t look like meat\n- Sprinkle with a Mrs. Dash type spice mixture and sauté on the stove until done\n- If it doesn’t feel jiggly and when you cut it in half and it isn’t pink, then it’s done\n- The smaller you cut the chicken prior to cooking it the quicker it cooks\n- Cover dough with olive oil (You can use canola oil if that’s what you have), then stretch it out to fit your pan. If you bought the pre-made crust, skip this step\n- You can use a pizza pan, cookie sheet, or a cake pan, whatever you have. Sometimes with the pre-made crust, you can set it right in the stove.\n- When stretching the dough, oil your hands. This will make it stretch out better\n- If using frozen dough, sprinkle some oil and corn meal on the pan.\n- Place dough on a pan and sprinkle with garlic salt and grated Parmesan cheese\n- Put barbecue sauce on crust and spread evenly, but not too much\n- Spread cheese on top\n- Sprinkle on onion and pineapple\n- For dough, cook in preheated oven for about 15 minutes at 450°\n- As for the pre-made crust, the package will usually tell you what temp and how long to cook it.  Take out of the oven and let it set for about 5 minutes before eating",

      "Description": "The best macaroni and cheese that will ever exist. Great for a large group of people, easy to make, not too time consuming. Easy to put together and keep in fridge or freezer to cook at another time.",
      "Ingredients": "- 4 T butter\n- 4 T flour\n- 1 tsp salt\n- 2 cups milk\n- 2 cups cheddar cheese\n- 2 – 2 ½ c uncooked pasta (I use shells, but you can use whatever you want. Just don't use spaghetti)\n- OPTIONAL - 1 pound of ham cut up.  I buy a ham steak. One ham steak will work\n- 2 T melted butter - optional but recommended \n- 1 cup cracker/bread crumbs - this is also optional but recommended",
      "Instructions": "- Preheat oven to 375°\n- Melt butter in a good size sauce pan\n- Add flour and mix well with a whisk until there are no lumps\n- Add salt and whisk\n- Add milk\n- Keep on a low heat and stir very frequently until it is thick. Heat up slowly so the milk doesn't burn.\n- Remove from heat\n- Add cheese and stir until melted.  (I add extra cheese)  \n- While you're doing this, heat your water in a pot for the pasta until it boils and then add pasta and cook\n- Cook it about a minute or two less than it says.  You want your pasta slightly under done, because it’s going to cook in the oven too\n- Mix together pasta, ham, and sauce\n- Put in a sprayed casserole dish\n- If you want a crumbled topping, melt butter and mix in bread crumbs\n- Put on top of Mac and cheese. \n- Put in preheated oven uncovered and bake for about 45 minutes or until it is bubbling and brown on top",

      "Description": "Like a pie but it is made of eggs",
      "Ingredients": "- 4 eggs\n- 2 cups evaporated milk  (can use whole milk, it just will be a little runnier, or half and half)\n- 1/3 cup chopped onion (1 small onion would work)\n- 10 slices cooked bacon or about 1 c chopped ham or 1 pound of cooked breakfast sausage. (can use any kind of meat you want or have. Or no meat at all and add a bunch of veggies like green or red pepper, broccoli)\n- 1 c shredded cheese, any kind\n- 1 nine inch deep dish pie crust (You can make this without the crust too.  Just spray the pie pan really good before you put everything in)",
      "Instructions": "- Preheat your oven to 425 degrees\n- Cook your meat if needed and drain grease off.  If you're doing sausage you can cook the onion with it\n- Spray pie pan\n- Put the pie crust in the pie pan and form it to the dish\n- Put cooked meat, onion and cheese on top of the crust\n- In a separate bowl beat eggs slightly with a fork\n- Add milk to eggs and blend\n- Pour into pie shell\n- Bake in preheated oven at 425 for 15 minutes\n- Turn down the oven to 325 for an additional 45 minutes into completely cooked.  \n- The edges of the crust should be like brown and so should the top of the quiche.  When you shake it gently it shouldn’t jiggle much and should feel firm.  Sometimes you have to cover the edges of the crust so they don’t burn with foil\n- Let cool for about 15 minutes, and it will cut better",
